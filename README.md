# Question

  The project `LegacyService` is a library written long time ago. Assuming the logic is perfectly **sound**, you are asked to refactor and modernise the code base, as well as improve its performance if possible.

## Tasks

### Complete the test project

- It is important to note that the `LegacyService` is not test covered, thus it is essential to complete the tests to ensure refactoring working.

### Refactoring by applying clean code principles e.g. SOLID and applicable design patterns

- Ideally async/await pattern should be applied;
- You can also leave your thoughts under **[Candidate-Comments](#Candidate-Comments)**;

## Restrictions

- `CandidateDataAccess` class and its `AddCandidate` method need to stay **static**
- Feel free to use you preferred Mock/Assertion libraries in the test projects

## Candidate Comments

- I originally wanted to leave some comments here, but ended up writing a lot of them. So instead I left the comments in the code, hoepfully easier to understand that way. I've also upgraded both projects to dotnet 8.0, the latest and greatest version of dotnet ^_^
